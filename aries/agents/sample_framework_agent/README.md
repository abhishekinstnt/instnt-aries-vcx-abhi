# Sample Framework Agent

The Sample Framework Agent is a sample agent intended to exersize and demonstrate usage of [Aries Framework VCX](../../../aries_framework_vcx/README.md). This may replace the existing `aries-vcx-agent`, or may compliment it. It's possible as a project we decide to instead convert the existing `aries-vcx-agent` and drop this agent.

**NOTE** -- this agent likely needs adjustments and additional consideration before being used directly in a production context.

## Running the Agent

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin sample_framework_agent
```
