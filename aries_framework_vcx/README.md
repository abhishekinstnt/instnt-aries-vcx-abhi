# Aries Framework VCX

Aries Framework VCX provides a simple and easy to use framework built on top of Aries VCX to provide Aries methods, including management of DIDComm connection and the exchange of AnonCreds credentials.

This framework provides cooridinating behaviors on top of Aries VCX, including record persistance, message delivery and processing, and mediator cooridination. Aries Framework VCX is available for use in Rust, Android (Kotlin), and iOS (Swift). Other platforms, including React Native and Flutter will be considered in the future.
